## Description:
Second Brain is a personal knowledge management and social sharing platform designed to capture, store, and organize your thoughts, ideas, and posts — just like messaging apps such as WhatsApp — but with a smarter approach to finding and sharing your content.

With Second Brain, you can create posts for anything — notes, memories, links, images, or ideas — and store them securely in your own digital space. Every post is easily searchable with tags, categories, and smart filters, making it effortless to find your content later, even after a long time.

Second Brain also makes sharing simple. You can share specific posts with friends, groups, or publicly, controlling exactly who sees what. Whether it's a private thought or a public idea, sharing is as easy as sending a message.
